# Tiny-ImageNet 64x64 Wide ResNet-34 + POT-QAT (Teacherâ€“Student KD)
This repository provides a full training and quantization pipeline for deploying **Wide ResNet-34** on **Tiny-ImageNet (64Ã—64)** with **Powers-of-Two Quantization (POT-QAT)** and **Knowledge Distillation (KD)**.

The pipeline supports:
- Full-precision (FP32) teacher training  
- Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with powers-of-two constraints  
- Teacherâ€“student distillation  
- Checkpoint saving and weight export (`.pth`, `.npz`, `.txt`)  
- Visualization of training curves  
- Randomized evaluation on validation samples

##  Training Pipeline

1. Full-Precision Teacher Training
2. POT-QAT (Student with KD)

# Flags

TRAIN_FP          # Phase 1: Train full-precision teacher
TRAIN_POT         # Phase 2: POT QAT (student) with KD
TEST              # Run a small test at the end
SAVE_FP           # Save FP teacher checkpoint
SAVE_POT          # Save final POT student checkpoint
EXPORT_POT        # Export weights to .npz/.txt
